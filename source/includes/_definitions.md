## Payment Methods

Many reservation systems provide a payment method between the agent and the operator. We have summarised these and provide the following payment options.

Payment Option | Description
--------- | -------
FULL_AGENT | Agent takes full payment for product, including any levies
DOWNPAYMENT_LEVY | Agent takes full payment for product, minus any levies. Customer will pay levy to operator on day of travel.
DOWNPAYMENT_BALANCE | Agent takes a deposit for the product, this is generally the agents commission. Customer will pay remainder to operator on day of travel.
FULL_SUPPLIER | Customer will pay total balance to operator on day of travel. Commission will need to be arranged with Operator outside of this API.

<aside class="warning">
For Rezdy products we do not support the "PAYOUTS" method. This is Rezdy's automated payment. For Rezdy products you need to negotiate with the operator on a rate and payment method.
